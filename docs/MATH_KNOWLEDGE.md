# average and mean

In statistics, average and "mean" are "arithmetic average".

(In this doc, mean is used as "arithmetic average")

It calculates for those set of vlaues which are more or less same.

```
(Sum of data number) / (Total quantity of data)

data = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
average = (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5) / 5 = 3
```

# deviation

Difference between data and mean. When deviation is big, it's not average.

```
deviation = X - m

X = data
m = mean
```

# variance

It tells how measured data distance from the mean value of the dataset.

```
r^2 = Sigma{ (X - m)^2 } / N

Sigma = Sum of
X = each value
m = mean
N = number of dataset
```

# standard deviation

It measures how much the data is spread out.

Value is positive square root of variance.

```
r = sqrt{ Sigma{ (X - m)^2 } / N }
```
